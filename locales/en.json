    "intro_paragraph1": "In Argentina, an open group of scholars, researchers, critics, librarians, students and stakeholders from different institutions and areas decided to consider together Digital Humanities (DH or HD) from the intersection between theory and practice, and from plurality and interdisciplinarity.",
    "intro_paragraph2": "After our first meeting at the Mariano Moreno National Library on September 27th, 2013, we held an open call, and we met on November 22nd at the Faculty of Humanities of the National University of La Plata with the aim of establishing the Argentine Association of Digital Humanities (AAHD).",
    "intro_paragraph3": "We believe that the HD are not a thematic discipline but a set of methodologies that cross our areas of interest. In fact, although digital technologies are nowadays present in the different stages of the research, regarding textual, discursive, symbolic and cultural productions (the search, diffusion, access and storage of information), DH foster overcoming this mere instrumental use.",
    "intro_paragraph4": "It is only by fulfilling this goal that they will allow a new way of approaching objects and problems related to social and humanistic research to:",
    "context_paragraph1": "We believe that the intrinsic incorporation of computer technologies into research processes in the field of Humanities leads to new methodologies, practices, resources, evidence, and questions for related disciplines, which require continuous investigation, training and updating. Due to this and despite our individual work and/or related to our production centers, we have decided to group ourselves in an association that will give us the opportunity to share resources, methods, training and results.",
    "context_paragraph2": "There are different associations and networks in Digital Humanities in different cultural fields; in the Ibero-American sphere, we are preceded by the Spanish Association HDH ({link1}), RedHD in Mexico ({link2}), and AHDig in Brazil ({link3}), each with related profiles and objectives related to the particular development of certain academic disciplines in their countries or regions.",
    "context_paragraph3": "In Argentina, several groups and people carry out their tasks within the assumptions and principles of the Digital Humanities. Those who attended the meeting in La Plata and Mariano Moreno National Library, and others previous meeting such as ThatCAMP Buenos Aires ({link4}), as well as those summoned by means of our website, have the will to express our intention to partner in order to establish an association of Digital Humanities in Argentina, based on the following incentives:",
